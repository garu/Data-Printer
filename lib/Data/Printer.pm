=head1 NAME

Data::Printer - colored & full-featured pretty print of Perl data structures and objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Want to see what's inside a variable in a complete, colored and human-friendly way?

    use DDP;  # same as 'use Data::Printer'

    p $some_var;
    p $some_var, as => "This label will be printed too!";

    # no need to use '\' before arrays or hashes!
    p @array;
    p %hash;

    # printing anonymous array references:
    p [ $one, $two, $three ]->@*;    # perl 5.24 or later!
    p @{[ $one, $two, $three ]};     # same, older perls
    &p( [ $one, $two, $three ] );    # same, older perls

    # printing anonymous hash references:
    p { foo => $foo, bar => $bar }->%*;   # perl 5.24 or later!
    p %{{ foo => $foo, bar => $bar }};    # same, older perls
    &p( { foo => $foo, bar => $bar } );   # same, older perls


The snippets above will print the contents of the chosen variables to STDERR
on your terminal, with colors and a few extra features to help you debug
your code.

If you wish to grab the output and handle it yourself, call C<np()>:

    my $dump = np $var;

    die "this is what happened: " . np %data;

The C<np()> function is the same as C<p()> but will return the string
containing the dump. By default it has no colors, but you can change that
easily too.


That's pretty much it :)

Data::Printer is L<fully customizable|/Properties Quick Reference>, even
on a per-module basis! Once you figure out your own preferences, create a
L<< .dataprinter configuration file|/The .dataprinter configuration file >>
for yourself (or one for each project) and Data::Printer will automatically
use it!

=head1 FEATURES

Here's what Data::Printer offers Perl developers, out of the box:

=over 4

=item * Variable dumps designed for I<< easy parsing by the human brain >>,
not a machine.

=back

=over 4

=item * B<< Highly customizable >>, from indentation size to depth level.
You can even rename the exported C<p()> function!

=back

=over 4

=item * B<< Beautiful (and customizable) colors >> to highlight variable dumps
and make issues stand-out quickly on your console. Comes bundled with
L<several themes|Data::Printer::Theme> for you to pick that work on light
and dark terminal backgrounds, and you can create your own as well.

=back

=over 4

=item * B<< L<Filters|/Filters> for specific data structures and objects >> to make
debugging much, much easier. Includes filters for many popular classes
from CPAN like JSON::*, URI, HTTP::*, LWP, Digest::*, DBI and DBIx::Class.
printing what really matters to developers debugging code. It also lets you
create your own custom filters easily.

=back

=over 4

=item * Lets you B<< inspect information that's otherwise difficult to find/debug >>
in Perl 5, like circular references, reference counting (refcount),
weak/read-only information, overloaded operators, tainted data, ties,
dual vars, even estimated data size - all to help you spot issues with your
data like leaks without having to know a lot about internal data structures
or install hardcore tools like Devel::Peek and Devel::Gladiator.

=back

=over 4

=item * keep your custom settings on a
L<< .dataprinter|/The .dataprinter configuration file >> file that allows
B<< different options per module >> being analyzed! You may also create a
custom L<profile|Data::Printer::Profile> class with your preferences and
filters and upload it to CPAN.

=back

=over 4

=item * B<< output to many different targets >> like files, variables or open
handles (defaults to STDERR). You can send your dumps to the screen
or anywhere else, and customize this setting on a per-project or even
per-module basis, like print everything from Some::Module to a debug.log
file with extra info, and everything else to STDERR.

=back

=over 4

=item * B<< Easy to learn, easy to master >>. Seriously, the synopsis above
and the customization section below cover about 90% of all use cases.

=back

=over 4

=item * Works on B<< Perl 5.8 and later >>. Because you can't control where
you debug, we try our best to be compatible with all versions of Perl 5.

=back

=over 4

=item * Best of all? All that with B<< No non-core dependencies >>,
Zero. Nada. So don't worry about adding extra weight to your project, as
Data::Printer can be easily added/removed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ever-popular Data::Dumper is a fantastic tool, meant to stringify
data structures in a way they are suitable for being "eval"'ed back in.
The thing is, a lot of people keep using it (and similar ones, like
Data::Dump) to print data structures and objects on screen for inspection
and debugging, and while you I<can> use those modules for that, it doesn't
mean you I<should>.

This is where Data::Printer comes in. It is meant to do one thing and one
thing only:

I<< format Perl variables and objects to be inspected by a human >>

If you want to serialize/store/restore Perl data structures, this module
will NOT help you. Try Storable, Data::Dumper, JSON, or whatever. CPAN is
full of such solutions!

Whenever you type C<use Data::Printer> or C<use DDP>, we export two functions
to your namespace:

=head2 p()

This function pretty-prints the contents of whatever variable to STDERR
(by default), and will use colors by default if your terminal supports it.

    p @some_array;
    p %some_hash;
    p $scalar_or_ref;

Note that anonymous structures will only work if you postderef them:

    p [$foo, $bar, $baz]->@*;

you may also deref it manually:

    p %{{ foo => $foo }};

or prefix C<p()> with C<&>:

    &p( [$foo, $bar, $baz] );    # & (note mandatory parenthesis)

You can pass custom options that will work only on that particular call:

    p @var, as => "some label", colorized => 0;
    p %var, show_memsize => 1;

By default, C<p()> prints to STDERR and returns the same variable being
dumped. This lets you quickly wrap variables with C<p()> without worrying
about changing return values. It means that if you change this:

    sub foo { my $x = shift + 13; $x }

to this:

    sub foo { my $x = shift + 13; p($x) }

The function will still return C<$x> after printing the contents. This form
of handling data even allows method chaining, so if you want to inspect what's
going on in the middle of this:

    $object->foo->bar->baz;

You can just add C<DDP::p> anywhere:

    $object->foo->DDP::p->bar->baz; # what happens to $object after ->foo?

Check out the L<customization quick reference|/Properties Quick Reference>
section below for all available options, including changing the return type,
output target and a lot more.

=head2 np()

The C<np()> function behaves exactly like C<p()> except it always returns
the string containing the dump (thus ignoring any setting regarding dump
mode or destination), and contains no colors by default. In fact, the only
way to force a colored C<np()> is to pass C<< colored => 1 >> as an argument
to each call. It is meant to provide an easy way to fetch the dump and send
it to some unsupported target, or appended to some other text (like part of
a log message).


=head1 CUSTOMIZATION

There are 3 possible ways to customize Data::Printer:

1. B<[RECOMMENDED]> Creating a C<.dataprinter> file either on your home
directory or your project's base directory, or both,  or wherever you set
the C<DATAPRINTERRC> environment variable to.

2. Setting custom properties on module load. This will override any
setting from your config file on the namespace (package/module) it was called:

    use DDP max_depth => 2, deparse => 1;

3. Setting custom properties on the actual call to C<p()> or C<np()>. This
overrides all other settings:

    p $var, show_tainted => 1, indent => 2;


=head2 The .dataprinter configuration file

The most powerful way to customize Data::Printer is to have a C<.dataprinter>
file in your home directory or your project's root directory. The format
is super simple and can be understood in the example below:

    # global settings (note that only full line comments are accepted)
    max_depth       = 1
    theme           = Monokai
    class.stringify = 0

    # use quotes if you want spaces to be significant:
    hash_separator  = " => "

    # You can set rules that apply only to a specific
    # caller module (in this case, MyApp::Some::Module):
    [MyApp::Some::Module]
    max_depth    = 2
    class.expand = 0
    escape_chars = nonlatin1

    [MyApp::Other::Module]
    multiline = 0
    output    = /var/log/myapp/debug.data

    # use 'quiet' to silence all output from p() and np()
    # called from the specified package.
    [MyApp::Yet::Another]
    quiet = 1

Note that if you set custom properties as arguments to C<p()> or C<np()>, you
should group suboptions as a hashref. So while the C<.dataprinter> file has
"C<< class.expand = 0 >>" and "C<< class.inherited = none >>", the equivalent
code is "C<< class => { expand => 0, inherited => 'none' } >>".

=head3 live updating your .dataprinter without restarts

Data::Printer 1.1 introduces a new 'live_update' flag that can be set to a
positive integer to enable live updates. When this mode is on, Data::Printer
will check if the C<.dataprinter> file has been updated and, if so, it will
reload it. This way you can toggle features on and off and control output
verbosity directly from your C<.dataprinter> file without needing to change
or restart running code.

=head2 Properties Quick Reference

=head3 Settings' shortcuts

=over 4

=item * B<as> - prints a string before the dump. So:

    p $some_var, as => 'here!';

is a shortcut to:

    p $some_var, caller_info => 1, caller_message => 'here!';

=item * B<multiline> - lets you create shorter dumps. By setting it to 0,
we use a single space as linebreak and disable the array index. Setting it
to 1 (the default) goes back to using "\n" as linebreak and restore whatever
array index you had originally.

=item * B<fulldump> - when set to 1, disables all max string/hash/array
values. Use this to generate complete (full) dumps of all your content,
which is trimmed by default.

=item * B<quiet> - when set to 1, disables all data parsing and returns as
quickly as possible. Use this to disable all output from C<p()> and C<np()>
inside a particular package, either from the 'use' call or from .dataprinter.
(introduced in version 1.1)

=back


=head2 Colors & Themes

Data::Printer lets you set custom colors for pretty much every part of the
content being printed. For example, if you want numbers to be shown in
bright green, just put C<< colors.number = #00ff00 >> on your configuration
file.

See L<Data::Printer::Theme> for the full list of labels, ways to represent
and customize colors, and even how to group them in your own custom theme.

The colorization is set by the C<colored> property. It can be set to 0
(never colorize), 1 (always colorize) or 'auto' (the default), which will
colorize C<p()> only when there is no C<ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED> environment
variable, the output is going to the terminal (STDOUT or STDERR) and your
terminal actually supports colors.


=head2 Profiles

You may bundle your settings and filters into a profile module.
It works like a configuration file but gives you the power and flexibility
to use Perl code to find out what to print and how to print. It also lets
you use CPAN to store your preferred settings and install them into your
projects just like a regular dependency.

    use DDP profile => 'ProfileName';

See L<Data::Printer::Profile> for all the ways to load a profile, a list
of available profiles and how to make one yourself.


=head2 Filters

Data::Printer works by passing your variable to a different set of filters,
depending on whether it's a scalar, a hash, an array, an object, etc. It
comes bundled with filters for all native data types (always enabled, but
overwritable), including a generic object filter that pretty-prints regular
and Moo(se) objects and is even aware of Role::Tiny.

Data::Printer also comes with filter bundles that can be quickly activated
to make it easier to debug L<binary data|Data::Printer::Filter::ContentType>
and many popular CPAN modules that handle
L<date and time|Data::Printer::Filter::DateTime>,
L<databases|Data::Printer::Filter::DB> (yes, even DBIx::Class),
L<message digests|Data::Printer::Filter::Digest> like MD5 and SHA1, and
L<JSON and Web|Data::Printer::Filter::Web> content like HTTP requests and
responses.

So much so we recommend everyone to activate all bundled filters by putting
the following line on your C<.dataprinter> file:

    filters = ContentType, DateTime, DB, Digest, Web

Creating your custom filters is very easy, and
you're encouraged to upload them to CPAN. There are many options available
under the C<< Data::Printer::Filter::* >> namespace. Check
L<Data::Printer::Filter> for more information!


=head2 Making your classes DDP-aware (without adding any dependencies!)

The default object filter will first check if the class implements a sub
called 'C<_data_printer()>' (or whatever you set the "class_method" option
to in your settings). If so, Data::Printer will use it to get the string to
print instead of making a regular class dump.

This means you could have the following in one of your classes:

  sub _data_printer {
      my ($self, $ddp) = @_;
      return 'Hey, no peeking! But foo contains ' . $self->foo;
  }

Notice that B<< you can do this without adding Data::Printer as a dependency >>
to your project! Just write your sub and it will be called with the object to
be printed and a C<$ddp> object ready for you. See
L<< Data::Printer::Object|Data::Printer::Object/"Methods and Accessors for Filter Writers" >>
for how to use it to pretty-print your data.

Finally, if your object implements string overload or provides a method called
"to_string", "as_string" or "stringify", Data::Printer will use it. To disable
this behaviour, set C<< class.stringify = 0 >> on your C<.dataprinter>
file, or call p() with C<< class => { stringify => 0 } >>.

Loading a filter for that particular class will of course override these settings.


=head1 CAVEATS

You can't pass more than one variable at a time.

   p $foo, $bar;       # wrong
   p $foo; p $bar;     # right

You can't use it in variable declarations (it will most likely not do what
you want):

    p my @array = qw(a b c d);          # wrong
    my @array = qw(a b c d); p @array;  # right

If you pass a nonexistant key/index to DDP using prototypes, they
will trigger autovivification:

    use DDP;
    my %foo;
    p $foo{bar}; # undef, but will create the 'bar' key (with undef)

    my @x;
    p $x[5]; # undef, but will initialize the array with 5 elements (all undef)

Slices (both array and hash) must be coerced into actual arrays (or hashes)
to properly shown. So if you want to print a slice, instead of doing something
like this:

    p @somevar[1..10]; # WRONG! DON'T DO THIS!

try one of those:

    my @x = @somevar[1..10]; p @x;   # works!
    p [ @somevar[1..0] ]->@*;        # also works!
    p @{[@somevar[1..0]]};           # this works too!!

Finally, as mentioned before, you cannot pass anonymous references on the
default mode of C<< use_prototypes = 1 >>:

    p { foo => 1 };       # wrong!
    p %{{ foo => 1 }};    # right
    p { foo => 1 }->%*;   # right on perl 5.24+
    &p( { foo => 1 } );   # right, but requires the parenthesis
    sub pp { p @_ };      # wrapping it also lets you use anonymous data.

    use DDP use_prototypes => 0;
    p { foo => 1 };   # works, but now p(@foo) will fail, you must always pass a ref,
                      # e.g. p(\@foo)

=head1 BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

While we make a genuine effort not to break anything on new releases,
sometimes we do. To make things easier for people migrating their
code, we have aggregated here a list of all incompatible changes since ever:

=over 4

=item * 1.00 - some defaults changed!
Because we added a bunch of new features (including color themes), you may
notice some difference on the default output of Data::Printer. Hopefully it's
for the best.

=item * 1.00 - new C<.dataprinter> file format.
I<< This should only affect you if you have a C<.dataprinter> file. >>
The change was required to avoid calling C<eval> on potentially tainted/unknown
code. It also provided a much cleaner interface.

=item * 1.00 - new way of creating external filters.
I<< This only affects you if you write or use external filters. >>
Previously, the sub in your C<filters> call would get the reference to be
parsed and a properties hash. The properties hash has been replaced with a
L<Data::Printer::Object> instance, providing much more power and flexibility.
Because of that, the filter call does not export C<p()>/C<np()> anymore,
replaced by methods in Data::Printer::Object.

=item * 1.00 - new way to call filters.
I<< This affects you if you load your own inline filters >>.
The fix is quick and Data::Printer will generate a warning explaining how
to do it. Basically, C<< filters => { ... } >> became
C<< filters => [{ ... }] >> and you must replace C<< -external => [1,2] >>
with C<< filters => [1, 2] >>, or C<< filters => [1, 2, {...}] >> if you
also have inline filters. This allowed us much more power and flexibility
with filters, and hopefully also makes things clearer.

=item * 0.36 - C<p()>'s default return value changed from 'dump' to 'pass'.
This was a very important change to ensure chained calls and to prevent
weird side-effects when C<p()> is the last statement in a sub.

Any undocumented change was probably unintended. If you bump into one,

=head1 TIPS & TRICKS

=head2 Using p() in some/all of your loaded modules

I<< (contributed by Matt S. Trout (mst)) >>

While debugging your software, you may want to use Data::Printer in some or
all loaded modules and not bother having to load it in each and every one of
them. To do this, in any module loaded by C<myapp.pl>, simply write:

  ::p @myvar;  # note the '::' in front of p()

Then call your program like:

  perl -MDDP myapp.pl

This also has the advantage that if you leave one p() call in by accident,
it will trigger a compile-time failure without the -M, making it easier to
spot :)

If you really want to have p() imported into your loaded modules, use the
next tip instead.

=head2 Adding p() to all your loaded modules

I<< (contributed by Árpád Szász) >>

If you wish to automatically add Data::Printer's C<p()> function to
every loaded module in you app, you can do something like this to
your main program:

    BEGIN {
        {
            no strict 'refs';
            require Data::Printer;
            my $alias = 'p';
            foreach my $package ( keys %main:: ) {
                if ( $package =~ m/::$/ ) {
                    *{ $package . $alias } = \&Data::Printer::p;
                }
            }
        }
    }

B<WARNING> This will override all locally defined subroutines/methods that
are named C<p>, if they exist, in every loaded module. If you already
have a subroutine named 'C<p()>', be sure to change C<$alias> to
something custom.

If you rather avoid namespace manipulation altogether, use the previous
tip instead.

=head2 Using Data::Printer from the Perl debugger

I<< (contributed by Árpád Szász and Marcel Grünauer (hanekomu)) >>

With L<DB::Pluggable>, you can easily set the perl debugger to use
Data::Printer to print variable information, replacing the debugger's
standard C<p()> function. All you have to do is add these lines to
your C<.perldb> file:

  use DB::Pluggable;
  DB::Pluggable->run_with_config( \'[DataPrinter]' );  # note the '\'

Then call the perl debugger as you normally would:

  perl -d myapp.pl

Now Data::Printer's C<p()> command will be used instead of the debugger's!

See L<perldebug> for more information on how to use the perl debugger, and
L<DB::Pluggable> for extra functionality and other plugins.

If you can't or don't want to use DB::Pluggable, or simply want to keep
the debugger's C<p()> function and add an extended version using
Data::Printer (let's call it C<px()> for instance), you can add these
lines to your C<.perldb> file instead:

    $DB::alias{px} = 's/px/DB::px/';
    sub px {
        my $expr = shift;
        require Data::Printer;
        print Data::Printer::p($expr);
    }

Now, inside the Perl debugger, you can pass as reference to C<px> expressions
to be dumped using Data::Printer.

=head2 Using Data::Printer in a perl shell (REPL)

Some people really enjoy using a REPL shell to quickly try Perl code. One
of the most popular ones out there is L<Devel::REPL>. If you use it, now
you can also see its output with Data::Printer!

Just install L<Devel::REPL::Plugin::DataPrinter> and add the following
line to your re.pl configuration file (usually ".re.pl/repl.rc" in your
home dir):

  load_plugin('DataPrinter');

The next time you run C<re.pl>, it should dump all your REPL using
Data::Printer!

=head2 Easily rendering Data::Printer's output as HTML

To turn Data::Printer's output into HTML, you can do something like:

  use HTML::FromANSI;
  use Data::Printer;

  my $html_output = ansi2html( np($object, colored => 1) );

In the example above, the C<$html_output> variable contains the
HTML escaped output of C<p($object)>, so you can print it for
later inspection or render it (if it's a web app).

=head2 Using Data::Printer with Template Toolkit

I<< (contributed by Stephen Thirlwall (sdt)) >>

If you use Template Toolkit and want to dump your variables using Data::Printer,
install the L<Template::Plugin::DataPrinter> module and load it in your template:

   [% USE DataPrinter %]

The provided methods match those of C<Template::Plugin::Dumper>:

   ansi-colored dump of the data structure in "myvar":
   [% DataPrinter.dump( myvar ) %]

   html-formatted, colored dump of the same data structure:
   [% DataPrinter.dump_html( myvar ) %]

The module allows several customization options, even letting you load it as a
complete drop-in replacement for Template::Plugin::Dumper so you don't even have
to change your previous templates!

=head2 Migrating from Data::Dumper to Data::Printer

If you are porting your code to use Data::Printer instead of
Data::Dumper, you could replace:

  use Data::Dumper;

with something like:

  use Data::Printer;
  sub Dumper { np @_, colored => 1 }

this sub will accept multiple variables just like Data::Dumper.

=head2 Unified interface for Data::Printer and other debug formatters

I<< (contributed by Kevin McGrath (catlgrep)) >>

If you want a really unified approach to easily flip between debugging
outputs, use L<Any::Renderer> and its plugins,
like L<Any::Renderer::Data::Printer>.

=head2 Printing stack traces with arguments expanded using Data::Printer

I<< (contributed by Sergey Aleynikov (randir)) >>

There are times where viewing the current state of a variable is not
enough, and you want/need to see a full stack trace of a function call.

The L<Devel::PrettyTrace> module uses Data::Printer to provide you just
that. It exports a C<bt()> function that pretty-prints detailed information
on each function in your stack, making it easier to spot any issues!

=head2 Troubleshooting apps in real time without changing a single line of your code

I<< (contributed by Marcel Grünauer (hanekomu)) >>

L<dip> is a dynamic instrumentation framework for troubleshooting Perl
programs, similar to L<DTrace|http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/>.
In a nutshell, C<dip> lets you create probes for certain conditions
in your application that, once met, will perform a specific action. Since
it uses Aspect-oriented programming, it's very lightweight and you only
pay for what you use.

C<dip> can be very useful since it allows you to debug your software
without changing a single line of your original code. And Data::Printer
comes bundled with it, so you can use the C<p()> function to view your
data structures too!

   # Print a stack trace every time the name is changed,
   # except when reading from the database.
   dip -e 'before { print longmess(np $_->{args}[1], colored => 1)
   if $_->{args}[1] } call "MyObj::name" & !cflow("MyObj::read")' myapp.pl

You can check L<dip>'s own documentation for more information and options.

=head2 Sample output for color fine-tuning

I<< (contributed by Yanick Champoux (yanick)) >>

The "examples/try_me.pl" file included in this distribution has a sample
dump with a complex data structure to let you quickly test color schemes.

=head1 VERSIONING AND UPDATES

As of 1.0.0 this module complies with C<Major.Minor.Revision> versioning
scheme (SemVer), meaning backwards incompatible changes will trigger a new
major number, new features without any breaking changes trigger a new minor
number, and simple patches trigger a revision number.
