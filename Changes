0.99_001 2018-04-21
    BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
        - new format for the .dataprinterrc file
    NEW FEATURES:
        - Data::Printer::Object available for public usage!
          (big thanks to frew && rjbs)
        - use DDP; p $foo, as => 'this is a label';
          Hopefully this helps people tag their debug code without having
          to write caller_info => 1, caller_message => '...'
        - theme => 'XXX' will try and load Data::Printer::Theme::XXX,
          which you can create to share your colour scheme with the world!
        - speaking of colours, you can now use up to 256 of them
          (if your terminal supports them, of course)
        - print only a slice of arrays and hashes with:
           - array_max => 10 (default is 50, set it to 0 for unlimited)
           - array_overflow => '(...skipping __SKIPPED__ items...)'
           - array_preserve => 'begin'
             if the array has more than array_max elements, preserve the first
             array_max elements and replace the rest with '(...skipping XX items...)'.
             Other available options are 'end', 'middle', 'extremes', and 'none'.
           - hash_max / hash_overflow / hash_preserve (same! note however that
             preserved keys will only be the same if hash keys are sorted)
             Defaults to 50.
        - ignore_keys to skip their dump (feature by Eugen Konkov)
        - string_max/string_overflow/string_preserve to limit string entries (scalars),
          just like arrays and hashes. Defaults to 1024 and 'begin'. Set it
          to 0 for unlimited size.
        - new 'separator', 'brackets' and 'overflow' colors to control
        - unicode_charnames, when set to 1 (together with escape_chars)
          will try and use the Unicode name when escaping strings.
          So `$s = "\x{2603}"; p $s` will output "\N{SNOWMAN}"
        - show_refcount => 1 exposes the reference count for the data structure
          (and inner data) if the count is greater than 1. (default 0, showing no refcounts).
        - show_memsize => 1 shows the (approximated) amount of memory the variable
          occupies for all variables on that level. This means that '1' will show
          the size of the entire data structure, while 2 will also show sizes of
          inner data, 3 will go even deeper and so on. To get the size of everything,
          use 'all' - though usually you'll probably want to just use '1'.
          This requires Devel::Size, so the default is 0 for none.
        - memsize_unit defined in which unit to show the memory usage. Can be
          set to 'b'(ytes), 'k'(ilobytes), 'm'(egabytes) or 'auto' (the default).
        - new property 'format_inheritance', defaults to "lines", a shiny and much
          clearer new way to displays methods per inherited package. You may also
          set it to 'string' to preserve the old behaviour.
        - inheritance tree is considered when filtering objects unless you disable
          it with 'parent_filters => 0' (Ovid)
        - new option 'stringify' (default: 1) will return the stringified version
          of the object, if one is available. It will try overloaded strings/numbers,
          as_string() and stringify() calls, respectively. Note that this will efectivelly
          ignore all other class details you may have chosen.
          (Sergey Aleynikov, Benct Philip Jonsson)
        - new option show_overloads (default: 1) will list all overloads
          from the object's class.
        - the standard class filter is now able to show internals in blessed subs
        - support for faster natural sorting via Sort::Key::Natural
          if the user has it installed (feature request by @grr on github)
    BUG FIXES:
        - fix array subelement alignment when index is shown (GARU)
        - show UNIVERSAL in linear ISA if it's on (GARU)
        - use "\n" instead of $/ as default line separator (Håkon Hægland && Chung-Kuan Tsai)
        - less magic added to internal Perl representation of variables
          (Jarrod Funnell, Sergey Aleynikov, Michael Conrad, Nicolas R.)
        - show_methods is now independent from show_inherited, meaning you can
          check all inherited methods and no local ones, or any combination thereof.
          This is the expected behaviour from the documentation, but was not happening.

          (Baldur Kristinsson)
        - Prevent some 5.8 errors caused by the version module
          (Baldur Kristinsson)
        - Data::Printer::Filter should imports np() as well
          (Olaf Alders)

0.36 2015-05-29
    Bumping 0.35_01 to stable. Below is the (repeated) changelog,
    with the single addition of the 'scalar_quotes' patch.

    BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
        - p()'s return value now defaults to 'pass'. Please see
          https://github.com/garu/Data-Printer/issues/16 for the
          full discussion. THIS WILL BREAK CODE RELYING ON p() TO
          RETURN A STRING. To fix your code, please set 'return_value'
          to 'dump' explicitly, or use the experimental np() function.

    NEW HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE:
        - np(), a version of p() that always returns the string instead
          of printing it.

    NEW FEATURES:
        - Add 'escape_chars' to allow \x{...} printing for chars
          (patch by Mark Fowler)
        - 'scalar_quotes' let you specify the quote to use when,
          well, quoting (Ivan Bessarabov)
        - Class::Date support in the DateTime filter (Ivan Bessarabov)

    BUG FIXES:
        - fixed crash in esoteric classes (github issue #41, thanks
          Ivan Bessarabov for reporting)
        - removed support for Digest::Haval256, as it can't really be
          observed without damaging the original data. If future versions
          provide a clone() function, it can be added again.
        - Being extra loud when rc files fail to load (RT#89203, thanks
          Caleb Cushing for reporting).
        - Prevents PERL5OPT from interfering with deparse tests (github
          issue #55, thanks David Precious for reporting)

    OTHER:
        - more tests
        - new external filter indexed: PDL

        - pod fix in DDP.pm (nuno carvalho)

    NEW HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE:
        - extra options for external filters. Right now
          the only available one is 'show_repeated', to
          let filters override Data::Printer's behaviour
          of not showing duplicate variables.

    NEW FEATURES:
        - new class property 'universal', letting you choose whether
          to include UNIVERSAL methods during inheritance display
          or not (default is 1, meaning to show).
        - support for VSTRINGs (Rebecca Turner)

    NEW ***EXPERIMENTAL*** FEATURES:

          contributors list. Thanks guys!

0.30_01   2012-07-02
    CHANGES THAT BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - linear_isa option is now set to 'auto' by default (see below)

    NEW FEATURES:
        - linear_isa can now be set to 'auto', in which case
          it will show the @ISA only if the object has more than
          one parent. Other values are 0 (never show) and 1 (always show)
        - new "Digest" filter bundle, for MD5, SHA and other Digest objects!
        - separate colours for classes and methods (feature request
          by Ivan Bessarabov)
        - environment variable DATAPRINTERRC overrides .dataprinter
          and lets you pick different RCs at will (Stephen Thirlwall)
        - new option 'separator' lets you pick a custom separator
          for array/hash elements, including none (''). Default is ','.
        - new option 'end_separator' can be set to 1 to show the last
          item of an array or hash with a separator (Ivan Bessarabov)
        - DateTime filter bundle now also handles DateTime::TimeZone
          objects (RT#77755)

    BUG FIXES:
        - RC file now works under taint mode, with restrictions
          (feature request by Rob Hoelz)
        - class_method call now includes properties hashref (Joel Berger)

    OTHER:
        - Replacement of dependencies to permit pure perl operation:
            Class::MOP is replaced with mro and Package::Stash
            Clone is replaced with Clone::PP
            Hash::FieldHash is replaced with Hash::Util::FieldHash
          Note that if <5.10 is detected, Data::Printer also requires:
            MRO::Compat to provide mro
            Hash::Util::FieldHash::Compat to provide Hash::Util::FieldHash
          As a result, Data::Printer should now be fatpackable (cpan:MSTROUT)
        - new /examples dir, with a sample file to let you easily try
          different color schemes (Yanick Champoux)
        - pod coverage tests (developer only)

0.30    2012-02-13
    CHANGES THAT BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - 'escape_chars' was renamed 'print_escapes' to
          avoid ambiguity. The old name will work until
          v0.32, but will trigger a warning so you can
          update your code. Sorry for the inconvenience,
          the previous name was hard to figure out because
          'escape' could be interpreted as a noun or as
          an adjective (perigrin++ for suggesting the new
          name).

    NEW FEATURES:
        - in hashes, surround key names with quotes if they
          contain spaces (feature request by Maxim Vuets)
        - escape_chars also works for hash keys now.
        - new 'quote_keys' property to add quotes in hash
          keys. Defaults to 'auto' which means it will
          quote keys containing spaces (and empty keys)

    BUG FIXES:
        - fixed temporary file handling during tests. Thanks
          Andy Bach for reporting and providing a patch.

    OTHER:
        - added documentation for the new 'rc_file' feature
          introduced in the previous version.

0.29    2012-01-25
    NEW FEATURES:
        - custom rc file names via the new 'rc_file' property
          (many thanks to Maxim Vuets for the idea and the
           original implementation)

    BUG FIXES:
        - fixed unescaped null character during colored output
          (reported by bowtie++)


0.28    2012-01-23
    NEW FEATURES:
        - new 'escape_chars' property to show '\t', '\n'
          escaped (default is 1, meaning escape, which
          will render the actual character instead). Note that
          the '\0' special character is never escaped.
        - new 'escaped' colour, defaults to bright red.

    OTHER:
        - fixed Changes file for compliance against latest
          CPAN::Changes specification

0.27    2012-01-22
    BUG FIXES:
        - properly escape nulls in strings (oylenshpeegul)

    NEW FEATURES:
        - control the output target with the 'output' property.
          It can be set to 'stdout', 'stderr', a file name,
          a file handle or even a scalar reference! Default, as
          usual, is 'stderr'

    OTHER:
        - added tests for auto-coloring (DOY)
        - updated link to Any::Renderer::Data::Printer (Allan Whiteford)

0.26    2011-11-23
    BUG FIXES:
        - colored => 'auto' properly detects terminals again

0.25    2011-11-20
    BUG FIXES:
        - Increased version requirement for Test::Pod to 1.41 (Fitz Elliott)
        - Updated tests to handle newer Class::MOP installations (J Mash)

    OTHER:
        - POD tests enabled only for developers
        - Updated Class::MOP version requirement to 0.81 since
          ActiveState was complaining about ancient versions.

0.24    2011-10-23
    NEW FEATURES:
        - link to the external URI filter (by SYP)
        - display object's reference type (Denis Howe)

    OTHER:
        - only load Class::MOP when inspecting objects.

0.23    2011-08-30
    NEW FEATURES:
        - control the return value with the 'return_value'
          property. This can be set to 'void', 'dump', and
          'pass' (for pass-through). Default is 'dump',
          which behaves exactly like previous versions. Note
          that, as usual, the 'dump' mode will only print
          the dump if called in void context. Otherwise, it
          will only return it. (MST, GARU)

    OTHER:
        - more extra tips (HANEKOMU, RANDIR, MST)
        - updated documentation

0.22    2011-07-19
    NEW FEATURES:
        - display taint information via the 'show_tainted'
          display customization (default true)
        - control weak information display via 'show_weak'
          customization (default true)
    OTHER:
        - major documentation overhaul and update
        - more extra tips (MST, HANEKOMU)

0.21    2011-07-01
    BUG FIXES:
        - removed legacy dependency on Object::ID
        - increased Term::ANSIColor version (David Raab)
        - switched to EU:MM to make people happy :)
          (seriously though, M:I was being too clever
           while resolving dependencies)
    OTHER:
        - adding bugtracker meta information

0.20    2011-06-23
    CHANGES THAT BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - respect ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED if colored => 'auto',
          but force color codes if colored => 1.
        - colored => 'auto' prints colored output only
          in void mode, not when returning a string. In other
          words, doing p($var) will show colors, but
          my $out = p($var) will not (unless you force it
          via colored => 1). This behavior differs from
          previous versions, but is more consistent and
          we consider the previous way to have been a bug.

          Many thanks to SZABGAB, CSJEWELL and specially RANDIR
          for detecting, analyzing and helping to come up with
          a solution, initially addressed as a Microsoft Windows
          issue (RT#68630).

    OTHER:
        - reduced some dependencies to make installation even easier.

0.19    2011-06-08
    NEW FEATURES:
        - toggle 'parents' class display, activated by default (RANDIR)
        - toggle 'show_methods' class display, activated by default (RANDIR, GARU)
        - toggle 'linear_isa' class display, activated by default

    BUG FIXES:
        - specific class filters now fallback to generic -class
          filters when used (RANDIR)
        - show flags from handles even when not all flags are
          implemented on the target system (DOHERTY, GARU)

0.18    2011-06-07
    NEW FEATURES:
        - toggle timezone display on DateTime filters (Elliot Shank)
        - showing weak references (RANDIR)
        - more concise output for empty structures (RANDIR)

    OTHER:
        - extra tip on unified dumping interfaces (cat|grep)
        - extra tip on using Data::Printer with Devel::REPL

0.17    2011-06-06
    NEW FEATURES:
        - filter fallback also for Perl types (RANDIR, GARU)
        - no need to pass arrayref in -external filters
          if you only have one.
        - new "use_prototypes" option, defaults to 1. Set to 0
          to stop using prototypes in p(), which will let you
          do p( { foo => "bar" } ); but you'll have to pass
          the data to be printed as a reference.

    BUG FIXES:
        - corrected filter order (should be LIFO, not FIFO)
        - fixed edge-case behavior of p() within standalone filters
        - make sure filter output is defined, not just true (RANDIR)
        - fixed filter tests for Date::Calc & Date::Pcalc (SUGYAN, GARU)

    OTHER:
        - more tests
        - big internal refactoring
        - extra tips on circumveinting prototypes (DAMS, GARU)
        - extra tips on loading p() across all loaded modules (Árpád Szász)

0.16    2011-05-31
    BUG FIXES:
        - patch to make it work on 5.8.8 again (RANDIR)

0.15    2011-05-30
    OTHERS:
        - updating filters docs
        - adding default color for DateTime filter

0.14    2011-05-30
    NEW FEATURES:
        - allowing 'colored' display customization to control colored
          output. Default is 'auto', showing colors only when
          output is not being piped. You may also set this to 0 to
          disable colors completely, or 1 to enable output coloring
          all the time (even when piped).
        - new 'caller_info' display customization.
        - default 'class_method' is now set to '_data_printer', so your
          modules and apps can be aware of Data::Printer automatically.

    BUG FIXES:
        - Skipping calls to fcntl() in systems that don't support it.

0.13    2011-05-24
    CHANGES THAT ***BREAK*** BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - 'external' is now called '-external' to avoid name clash
          with a potential "external.pm" class;
        - filters for the same type/class are now stacked and called
          in order. The first one that returns a defined value (string)
          is used, otherwise it will forward the call to the next filter.
          In earlier versions, the last declared filter would be the one
          used. Note that this feature is only available for stand-alone
          filters, since inline filters are actually a hash.

    NEW FEATURES:
        - use a specific dump method via the 'class_method' display
          customization (default undef)
        - display tie information via the 'show_tied' display
          customization (default true)
        - display extra information (mode, flags, layers) on I/O handles
        - new '-class' type (note the dash) called when we find a
          non-native type (i.e. an object). If you return anything at
          all - even an empty string - the filter will succeed. Otherwise
          it will forward the call to the next '-class' filter, in order.
        - new DDP package alias


    OTHERS:
        - improved test suite
        - improved documentation

0.12    2011-05-03
    BUG FIXES:
        - fixed failing filter test due to timezone/epoch issues

0.11    2011-05-03
    NEW FEATURES:
        - allowing 'sort_keys' display customization (default true)
        - allowing 'sort_methods' class display customization (default true)
        - now you can add options to Data::Printer as a plain hash, not
          just as a hash ref (feature request by edenc)

    NEW ***EXPERIMENTAL*** FEATURES:
        - Data::Printer::Filter, enabling separate filter classes
        - filter for modules handling date and time (DateTime & friends)
        - filter for database modules (DBI only for now)

    OTHERS:
        - more tests
        - improved documentation, including how to turn output to HTML
        - some internal refactorings

0.10    2011-04-18
    NEW FEATURES:
        - allowing toggle for array indices

        - allowing 'max_depth' display customization
        - allowing 'inherited' class display customization
        - allowing 'expand' class display customization, defaults
          to 1 (expand only the object itself)

    OTHERS:
        - removed ending comma from arrays and hashes
        - showing parents/ISA information only when it's there
        - default separator for key/values reduced to 3 spaces for
          improved readability.
        - improved test suite

0.09    2011-04-13
    NEW FEATURES:
        - allowing for 'internals' display customization

    BUG FIXES:
        - improving test suite
        - improving documentation

0.08    2011-04-11
    BUG FIXES:
        - improving test suite (was still failing on NetBSD)
        - Improved handling of extended regexps (thanks Getty for reporting)

0.07    2011-04-02
    BUG FIXES:
        - Making sure File::HomeDir is 0.91 or higher
        - Making tests stricter, since they were failing on Win32

0.06    2011-03-31
    BUG FIXES:
        - if you want to call p() from within a filter, the
          argument to p() must be passed as a *reference*. This
          is now enforced to avoid users shooting themselves in the foot.
        - more tests added

0.05    2011-03-23
    NEW FEATURES:
        - local configuration file support ($HOME/.dataprinter)
        - you can now alias p() to whatever name you like

    BUG FIXES:
        - reseting colors before starting

0.02    2011-02-13

    CHANGES THAT BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - d() function removed. You can now call p($var) in void context to print,
          or as "my $output = p($var)" to retrieve results without printing.

    NEW FEATURES:
        - new import syntax, use Data::Printer { option => value }
        - new "filters" property available to filter certain types.
        - updated documentation.

    NEW ***EXPERIMENTAL*** FEATURES
        - local properties setting, p($var, key => value).

    BUG FIXES:
        - properly handles GLOB references
        - colors now work on Win32 as well.
        - uncolors piped output, for "less" & friends (thanks Getty for reporting).
        - added all possible regex modifiers to the regex output.
        - more tests added.


0.01    2011-01-20
